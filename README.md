# CLOUDNOTE  APP

Hi! My name is Sourabh Jyoti Das, I have created this web application.

CLOUDNOTE is a free browser-based text editor that allows you to create and edit multiple plain-text files in your browser. It is great for writing quick notes and printing a simple page. CLOUDNOTE is packed with core features that your common text editor provides, including  copy, cut, paste, open and save files, and print page.
Registration and login required. So, no one can access your saving notes .
